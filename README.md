# Dotfiles

This is a git repo containing my personal NixOS system and user configurations.
Currently it only serves my T480, and I'll have to migrate my server's config to here.

## Inspiration // Credit
This repository is inspired by jordanisaacs' [dotfiles](https://github.com/jordanisaacs) repo over at GitHub, Files under `lib/` are mostly taken from his repo, and some `modules/`, but I've added a few of my own.
