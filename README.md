# Dotfiles
Repo containing my nix-darwin & NixOS configurations.

## // NOTICE //
// I do and will use macOS on my T480 until Apple drops Intel support, as Linux has been getting tiresome for me.

// This means that I don't use NixOS on my desktop anymore, which is what this repo was oriented for earlier.

// Instead, now this repo has split into two branches: `nixos` and `stream`, stream is my personal word for master.

// `nixos` will serve my still working NixOS configuration, but do not expect it to get updated for now.


### Inspiration
This and the pre-split version of the repository base itself off of Jordan Isaacs' [dotfiles](https://github.com/jordanisaacs/dotfiles) repo, which in turn bases itself off of [Wil Taylor's](https://github.com/wiltaylor/dotfiles).
That said, I have made slight modifications since starting the repo, and now had to make it a concept compatible with nix-darwin.
