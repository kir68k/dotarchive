# TODO list for the dotfiles repo

### Todo
- [ ] Better handling of `isolcpus` (`config.ki.virtualisation.libvirt.isolateCpus`)
    - Currently this is pretty imperative, it's used for my Windows 10 VM to which I delegate 4 logical cores, isolating them.

- [ ] Migrate server config here
    - Currently the server config resides on a different repo, with a way different structure and foundation. It is less flexible and harder to change than this one.
